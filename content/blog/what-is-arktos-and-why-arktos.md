Arktos is an open source project designed for large-scale cloud infrastructure. It’s a cluster management system, as well as a container and VM orchestration system. The project is licensed under Apache 2.0 and is fully open and public.

Arktos was evolved from the Kubernetes codebase and features a lot of similar API objects — like pods and replica sets. But Arktos has core design changes, including fundamental improvements in areas like VM orchestration, scalability and multitenancy.

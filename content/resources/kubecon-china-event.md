## Centaurus

We announced an exciting open source project, Centaurus, which consists of two sub-projects, namely [Arktos](https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/arktos) and [Mizar](https://github.com/futurewei-cloud/mizar), is building the next generation large-scale and high-performance infrastructure platform.

## Lightning Talk - Ying Xiong

Dr. Ying Xiong, our Head of Cloud Lab and Technical VP of Cloud Platform from Futurewei Technolgoies, did a lightning talk on the challenges and opportunities that are shaping the future of Cloud Native infrastructure in the Age of AI, 5G and Edge.

More specifically, the combination of next generation AI and 5G applications poses major challenges for cloud infrastructure platform to support low latency and high scalability requirements of future cloud workloads. The convergence of Edge with the Cloud is driving the innovation of cloud platform architecture for unified management and large scale geographic deployment across data center and edge infrastructure. In this talk, we introduce a new open source project that provides a highly scalable and truly multi-tenant cloud native infrastructure to build next generation public and/or private cloud. We will present two open source components - Arktos, the large scale and partitioned compute cluster with unified management of cloud resource and workload including VMs and container, and Mizar, the high performance and low latency cloud networking solution that leverages advanced network technologies such as XDP/eBPF and Geneva protocol. Together, Arktos and Mizar deliver a new generation of cloud platform aiming to meet the challenges in the age of AI, 5G and Edge. In this talk, we will also give the use case of autonomous driving that can benefit from the new open source project.

## Unified Runtime Service Infrastructure for Containers and VMs - Yunwen Bai, Peng Du

We also had Yunwen Bai and Peng Du, our senior architects at Futurewei Cloud Lab doing a deep dive on unified runtime service infrastructure for containers and VMs.

Today, cloud providers provide services that orchestrate containers and VMs with different runtime services. As a container orchestration platform, Kubernetes uses a CRI interface specifically designed for containers. In this talk, Yunwen and Peng talked about how we orchestrate VMs and containers using a unified runtime service and the challenges behind the work we have done.

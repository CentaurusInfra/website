# Centaurus @ ONE Summit 2022

Centaurus attended the ONE Summit 2022 in Seattle from Nov 15 - Nov 16.  We also featured at the Cloud and Metaverse co-located event hosted by one of our core partners, Futurewei. We shared highlights of our works and how that can contribute to the Metaverse community. 


## Co-located Events - Cloud and Metaverse

The metaverse is believed to be the next evolutionary digital platform that offers virtual-reality experiences, a Web3 framework for economic interoperability, a creative place for social connections, or a hybrid of the above. It has received tremendous attention from not just the Tech industry but also other industries such as Entertainment, Gaming, Healthcare, Financial, Retail, etc. Leading Cloud Service Providers have been putting significant investments in building out their own proprietary metaverse enabling technologies and services while there are also various open source and standard projects and efforts that are in the works to meet the vision of the metaverse. It is conceivable that the massive compute, network, storage, edge, and security requirements to support a graphic intensive virtual reality universe will bring tremendous opportunities as well as challenges to Cloud Computing.
